    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans black beans</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed cooked ham</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
    </ol>
