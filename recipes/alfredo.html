    <h2>An Italian Staple</h2>

    <p>This creamy, garlicky, smooth Alfredo sauce is the absolute best. You do not want to use a grated Parmesan that you buy on a shelf. When you cook with that type, your Alfredo goes from a sauce to a gooey mess. You want to buy a very good and very hard Parmesan cheese in triangle form. Also, make sure the cream doesn't boil too much or there will not be enough liquid to make the Alfredo sauce smooth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
